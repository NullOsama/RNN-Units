# RNN-Units
Low level implementation of basic and LSTM Recurrent units

Using numpy only, I have implemented the forward propagation of a standard RNN and an LSTM RNN.

**Note:** Math explinations and discussions are inspired from [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (with Andrew ng) offered by Coursera.

**Working on deriving backpropagation...**
